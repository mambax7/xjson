How do I call this API?
The API is farely simple to use - you have a plugin which is a function on the api which has a filename say xoops_create_user.php which has an XSD in it as well as the function itself which is named after the filename. The API takes JSON Packages of variable and provide JSON response. You will have to check the plugin functions to see them implemented as to what they do and how to use them. But you can also call multiple function in a single call in this version.

Just say you where going to call the example function it would look as a URL something like this, You can use a $_GET or a $_POST depending on the data size.
Quote:

yoursite.com/modules/xjson/?xoops_create_user={...JSON VARIABLES...}

If you where going to call multiple functions the url call would look like this with a $_GET.
Quote:

yoursite.com/modules/xjson/?xoops_create_user={...JSON VARIABLES...}&secondary_function={...JSON VARIABLES...}&third_function={...JSON VARIABLES...}
